Twisted Node Starter
====================

Jump start node.js web app development with this project. Most node projects like this use Stylus (or LESS), Bootstrap. This project, however, uses SASS and Foundation v3.2

This project consists of the following components
- [Express]()
- [Jade]() templates
- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) via [node-sass](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass), which wraps libsass
- [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) for authentication
  - using [bcrypt](https://npmjs.org/package/bcrypt) to salt and encrpyt passwords
- [Foundation 3](http://foundation.zurb.com/) as the CSS framework
